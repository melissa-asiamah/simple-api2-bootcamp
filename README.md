# Simple Random Joke Generating App
This is a small app that returns a joke at the click of a button!

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API

I made this by using a randomized joke API. I attached it to an click event listener function, so with each click the user recieves a new joke each time.

## Lessons Learned:

THrough building this project, I learned how APIs work. I learned about JSON and how JSON is basically a giant array that holds a bunch of objects with key-value pairs you can access using a combination of dot notation or optional brackets to select which index you need from the JSON array.
